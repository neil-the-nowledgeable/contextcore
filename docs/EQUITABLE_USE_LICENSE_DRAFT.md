# Equitable Use License

**Version 1.0 — DRAFT**

*Thoughtful. Careful. Inclusive.*

*Liberation from false scarcity.*

---

## Preamble: Declaration of Intent

This license is born from a fundamental belief: technology should liberate people, not concentrate power. Software built through human creativity and labor should benefit those who create it and those who use it—equitably.

We reject the premise that scarcity must govern access to digital tools. We reject systems that reward extraction over contribution. We reject the notion that efficiency gains from eliminating jobs should flow to shareholders rather than workers.

This license is an invitation to participate in a different kind of economy—one where the vast majority of users (90-95%) pay little to nothing compared to the value they receive, where those who have extracted wealth from harmful systems contribute proportionally more, and where excess revenue flows to communities historically excluded from technological prosperity.

We hope that through the creation of genuinely valuable technology, people will be happy to contribute not because they must, but because they believe in the mission.

## Article III: User Classifications and Fee Structure

This License operates on a principle of generosity: most Users pay nothing or very little. We hope that those who receive value will contribute according to their means and their belief in our mission.

### 3.1 Category A: Free Access (90-95% of Users)

The following Users may use the Licensed Material at no cost:

| User Type | Conditions | Fee |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| Individuals | Personal, non-commercial use | $0 |
| Small Businesses | Annual revenue under $1 million | $0 |
| Medium Businesses | Annual revenue under $100 million and an Equitable Organization | $0 |
| Non-Profit Organizations | 501(c)(3) or equivalent status | $0 |
| Educational Institutions | Accredited schools, universities, training programs | $0 |
| Worker Cooperatives | Democratically owned and operated | $0 |
| Open Source Projects | Using OSI-approved or equivalent licenses | $0 |
| Restorative Access Beneficiaries | As defined in Article IV, regardless of revenue | $0 |

### 3.2 Category B: Equitable Fee (3-5% of Users)

The following Users are invited to pay an Equitable Fee: Large Corporations (annual revenue $100M+ without Restorative Access founders) and Healthcare Companies (for-profit healthcare providers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies).

#### 3.2.1 Value-Share Foundation (First $10 Million in Documented Value)

Category B Users are invited to contribute 5-10% of documented cost savings, efficiency gains, or productivity improvements derived from the Licensed Material.

**"Documented value"** includes but is not limited to: reduced labor costs from automation or process improvement, time savings converted to dollar equivalents at fully-loaded labor rates, avoided expenses from replacing commercial alternatives, and revenue gains directly attributable to capabilities enabled by the Licensed Material.

Users may self-report documented value annually. We trust good-faith estimates—precision matters less than participation.

| Documented Annual Value | Suggested Contribution Rate |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Up to $500,000 | 5% of documented value |
| $500,000 – $2,000,000 | 7% of documented value |
| $2,000,000 – $10,000,000 | 10% of documented value |

#### 3.2.2 Success Sharing (Beyond $10 Million in Documented Value)

When a Category B User's cumulative documented value from the Licensed Material exceeds $10 million, the contribution model shifts:

| Cumulative Value Threshold | Contribution Rate | Destination |
|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| $10M – $25M | 12% of incremental value | 50% to Foundation operations, 50% to Worker & Community Fund |
| $25M – $50M | 15% of incremental value | 25% to Foundation operations, 75% to Worker & Community Fund |
| $50M+ | 15% of incremental value | 100% to Worker & Community Fund |

#### 3.2.3 Worker & Community Fund Distribution

Contributions to the Worker & Community Fund shall be distributed according to the following priorities:

(a) **First priority — Direct worker benefit:** Workers employed by the contributing User, starting with the lowest-compensated and most vulnerable (temporary workers, contractors, part-time employees, those in roles most susceptible to displacement).

(b) **Second priority — Worker communities:** Communities where the contributing User's workers live, with emphasis on historically disinvested neighborhoods, rural communities, and areas with concentrated poverty.

(c) **Third priority — Broader worker solidarity:** Worker-owned cooperatives, labor organizations, and mutual aid networks in the contributing User's industry or region.

(d) **Fourth priority — Disability cooperative beneficiaries:** The Foundation's partner disability cooperative, to ensure existing beneficiaries live comfortable lives before expanding to new beneficiaries.

#### 3.2.4 The Threshold Question

*The specific thresholds above ($10M, $25M, $50M) are provisional. We will refine these based on real-world adoption and in consultation with early Category B users and the communities we serve. The principle is fixed; the numbers will evolve.*

#### 3.2.5 Anti-Accumulation Safeguard

The Foundation commits that once annual contributions exceed operational needs (as defined in the Foundation Charter), 100% of excess contributions flow through to the Worker & Community Fund and the disability cooperative. The Foundation exists as a conduit, not a destination.

### 3.3 Category C: Maximum Fee (1-2% of Users)

The following Users face the Maximum Fee. This is not punitive—it is recognition that those who have profited most from extractive systems should contribute proportionally to repair:

| User Type | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Fossil Fuel Companies | Contribution to climate destruction and environmental injustice |
| Federal Government Agencies | Participation in systems of mass surveillance, militarism, immigration enforcement, and the perpetuation of structural inequality; possession of effectively unlimited resources extracted through taxation |
| State Government Agencies | Enforcement of inequitable laws, participation in mass incarceration, and administration of systems that perpetuate racial and economic inequality; access to tax-derived resources |
| Local Government Agencies | Enforcement of property-based inequality through policing, zoning, and taxation policies that entrench segregation and displacement |
| Military Contractors and Agencies | Participation in systems of violence and destruction |
| Law Enforcement Agencies | Participation in mass incarceration, disproportionate targeting of marginalized communities, and enforcement of laws designed to protect property over people |
| Intelligence Agencies | Mass surveillance, erosion of civil liberties, and participation in covert operations that destabilize communities domestically and internationally |
| Immigration Enforcement | Participation in family separation, detention, and deportation systems that cause immeasurable human suffering |
| Private Prison Operators | Profiting from incarceration and human captivity |
| Investment Banks | Facilitation of wealth concentration and financial extraction |
| International Agribusiness | Exploitation of land, labor, and ecosystems at scale |
| Companies in Concentrated Markets | Using market power to extract disproportionate value |
| Lobbyists | Distorting democratic processes for private gain |
| Manufactured Complexity Industries | Creating unnecessary complexity to profit from navigation (e.g., tax preparation) |
| Individuals with Excessive Wealth | Personal assets exceeding $100 million |
| Families Benefiting from Historical Injustice | Intergenerational wealth derived from slavery, Jim Crow, or similar systemic exploitation |
| Organizations Using Forced Ranking Systems | Policies requiring predetermined percentages of workers be rated as underperformers (stack ranking, rank-and-yank, forced distribution curves) treat workers as disposable and manufacture artificial scarcity |

### 3.4 Religious and Spiritual Organizations

Churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other religious or spiritual organizations are classified as follows:

(a) **Free Access:** Religious organizations that demonstrate clear, material commitment to improving the lives of their members and broader community—through direct service, mutual aid, housing assistance, food security programs, healthcare access, education, or other tangible support—may use the Licensed Material at no cost.

(b) **Equitable Fee:** Religious organizations that have accumulated substantial resources (endowments, real estate holdings, investment portfolios) while demonstrating patterns of wealth preservation over community service, prioritizing institutional growth over member welfare, or showing greater interest in maintaining social order than improving the human condition, shall pay an Equitable Fee proportional to their accumulated assets.

(c) **Maximum Fee:** Religious organizations that actively cause harm—including but not limited to facilitating abuse, promoting discrimination, or operating as wealth extraction vehicles while neglecting their stated spiritual mission—are subject to the Maximum Fee.

*Note: This determination rests on observable patterns of resource allocation and community impact, not on theological positions. Organizations are invited to self-assess and contribute accordingly.*

## Article IV: Restorative Access Provisions

Restorative Access is permanent, unconditional free access for founders and organizations from historically excluded communities. This is not charity. This is recognition that these communities have been owed access to wealth-building tools for generations. We are simply removing barriers that should never have existed.

### 4.1 Qualifying Communities

Restorative Access is available to any startup, business, or organization where one or more founders or principals self-identify as:

(a) African American, Black, or descendants of enslaved peoples;

(b) Indigenous peoples, including members of federally recognized tribes, state-recognized tribes, unrecognized tribes, First Nations peoples, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Natives;

(c) First or second generation immigrants, regardless of documentation status;

(d) Refugees, asylum seekers, or those who fled systematic persecution;

(e) Formerly incarcerated individuals;

(f) LGBTQ+ individuals;

(g) Individuals with disabilities;

(h) First-generation college graduates;

(i) Individuals who emerged from extreme poverty.

### 4.2 Terms of Restorative Access

- **No applications required.** We trust people to self-identify honestly.
- **No documentation required.** The bureaucratic burden of proving marginalization is itself a form of marginalization.
- **No revenue limits.** Grow as large as you can. Success is celebrated, not penalized.
- **No time limits.** Restorative Access is permanent.
- **Full commercial rights.** Use, modify, distribute, and profit without restriction.

## Article V: Worker Protection Provisions

The Licensed Material is provided to empower people, not eliminate them. Efficiency gains from technology should benefit workers, not displace them.

### 5.1 Anti-Displacement Principle

Using the Licensed Material to eliminate jobs, reduce workforce, or automate human labor as a cost-cutting measure—rather than to enhance human capability—is a violation of this License.

### 5.2 Worker Benefit Requirement

Any cost savings, efficiency gains, or productivity improvements derived from the Licensed Material shall be distributed as follows:

(a) **Primary benefit to affected workers:** At least 50% of documented savings shall flow to workers whose roles were enhanced, changed, or at risk of elimination.

(b) **Retraining and transition support:** At least 25% of documented savings shall fund retraining, education, or transition assistance for workers.

(c) **Organizational discretion:** The remaining 25% may be allocated at organizational discretion.

### 5.3 Displacement Remedy

If any User displaces workers using the Licensed Material in violation of Section 5.1:

(a) **Compensation requirement:** The User shall pay each Displaced Worker an amount equal to two (2) years of their total compensation, including salary, benefits, and equity.

(b) **Prior displacement queue:** Workers previously displaced by the User through RIFs or pretextual performance improvement processes are entitled to benefits before any amounts flow to the organization.

(c) **Audit rights:** The Licensor and Displaced Workers shall have the right to audit User employment records to verify compliance.

### 5.4 Compensation Ratio

Users who are not Equitable Organizations (those with compensation ratios exceeding 50:1) are subject to Equitable Fees regardless of other classifications. Excessive compensation inequality is incompatible with equitable use.

### 5.5 Forced Ranking Systems Prohibition

Users who maintain forced ranking, stack ranking, rank-and-yank, or similar policies that require a predetermined percentage of workers to be rated as underperformers—regardless of actual performance—are in violation of this License.

(a) **Definition:** A forced ranking system is any performance evaluation policy that mandates termination, demotion, or adverse action against a fixed quota or percentage of workers based on relative ranking rather than objective performance standards.

(b) **Rationale:** Forced ranking systems manufacture artificial scarcity, pit workers against each other, disproportionately harm workers from marginalized backgrounds, and fundamentally contradict the principle that technology should empower people rather than eliminate them.

(c) **Consequence:** Organizations maintaining forced ranking policies are automatically classified as Category C (Maximum Fee) regardless of other characteristics, and workers terminated under such systems are entitled to remedies under Section 5.3.

(d) **Cure:** Users may cure this violation by formally abolishing forced ranking policies and committing to performance evaluation systems based on objective criteria and individual development rather than forced distribution curves.

---

## Article VI: Prohibited Uses

The following uses of the Licensed Material are absolutely prohibited. Violation results in immediate license termination with no opportunity for cure.

### 6.1 Fascism and Authoritarianism

The Licensed Material may not be used by, for, or in support of fascist movements, authoritarian regimes, or organizations that advocate for the suppression of democratic processes, civil liberties, or human rights.

### 6.2 Genocide and Systematic Oppression

The Licensed Material may not be used by any User, or any customer, agent, partner, or substantial contributor of a User, who participates in or contributes to genocide, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, or systematic oppression of any people based on race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, gender, sexuality, disability, or other protected characteristics.

### 6.3 Weapons and Surveillance

The Licensed Material may not be used in the development, production, or deployment of weapons systems, mass surveillance infrastructure, or technologies designed to harm, control, or oppress human beings.

---

## Article VII: Termination and Remedies

### 7.1 Automatic Termination

This License terminates automatically upon any violation of Article VI (Prohibited Uses). No notice is required.

### 7.2 Termination with Cure Period

For violations of Articles III, IV, or V, the User shall have thirty (30) days from written notice to cure the violation. If the violation is cured within this period, the License is reinstated. If not cured, the License terminates permanently.

### 7.3 Remedies

Upon termination for cause:

(a) All rights granted under this License immediately cease;

(b) The User shall immediately cease all use of the Licensed Material;

(c) Any amounts owed under Article III or V become immediately due;

(d) The Licensor may pursue all remedies available at law or in equity;

(e) For worker displacement violations, 100% of forfeiture amounts flow to Displaced Workers; the Foundation retains nothing.

### 7.4 Survival

Sections 5.3 (Displacement Remedy), 7.3 (Remedies), Article VIII (Limitation of Liability), and Article X (General Provisions) survive termination.
