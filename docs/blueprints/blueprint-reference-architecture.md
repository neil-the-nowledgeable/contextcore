# ContextCore: OTel Blueprint Reference Architecture

> **This document has been split into two focused documents.**
>
> The original combined blueprint and reference architecture content now lives in:
>
> - **[Blueprint: Project Management Observability](blueprint-project-management-observability.md)** — Strategic guidance following the Rumelt template (Diagnosis / Guiding Policies / Coherent Actions). Environment-agnostic.
>
> - **[Reference Architecture: ContextCore](reference-architecture-contextcore.md)** — Concrete implementation case study with code, architecture diagrams, results, and lessons learned. ContextCore-specific.
>
> **Why the split?** Blueprints (#235) provide strategic guidance written by the SIG. Reference architectures (#236) provide real-world case studies written by end-users. The original document combined both halves, which created confusion when linked from OTel SIG discussions.
>
> See [05-reference-architecture-template.md](otel-submission/05-reference-architecture-template.md) for the template that defines this distinction.
