# ContextCore Value Propositions
# Machine-readable format for generating marketing materials, dashboards, and documentation

mission:
  statement: >
    Eliminate manual status reporting to the extent possible through extrapolation
    of existing artifact metadata of your applications and systems, regardless of
    the programming language, infrastructure, and runtime environments used, and
    provide context for the generation of observability strategies based on system
    construction.

  tagline: "Project Management Observability Framework"
  subtitle: "A natural extension of OpenTelemetry for unified project and operational telemetry"

core_positioning:
  what_it_is:
    - "Open source project management observability framework"
    - "Natural extension of OpenTelemetry patterns"
    - "SDK for tasks-as-spans telemetry"
    - "Semantic conventions for project metadata"
    - "OTLP export to any compatible backend"

  what_it_is_not:
    - "Not an observability backend"
    - "Not a replacement for Jira/Linear/GitHub Issues"
    - "Not a new system to deploy and maintain"
    - "Not a new database"
    - "Not a new login context"

key_benefits:
  - id: eliminate_silo
    title: "Eliminate the Project Management Data Silo"
    description: >
      Traditional PM tools create a data silo not designed for developers or development
      workflows. ContextCore puts project data where developers already work — in their
      observability stack.
    problems_solved:
      - "PM tools require context switching"
      - "Manual data entry leads to stale, incomplete data"
      - "Different query languages can't correlate with ops data"
      - "Developers avoid PM tools"
    result: "Project data lives where developers already work"

  - id: eliminate_toil
    title: "Eliminate Developer Toil"
    description: >
      Stop asking developers to write status reports. The information already exists
      in their artifacts.
    toil_eliminated:
      - task: "Weekly status emails"
        solution: "Auto-generated from commit/PR activity"
      - task: "Manual Jira updates"
        solution: "Status derived from git activity"
      - task: "Sprint retro data prep"
        solution: "Metrics computed from span data"
      - task: "'What's the status?' pings"
        solution: "Self-service dashboards"
      - task: "Duplicate entry (git + Jira)"
        solution: "Single source of truth"
    time_saved: "2-4 hours per developer per week"

  - id: eliminate_dependence
    title: "Eliminate Dependence on Developer Status Reports"
    description: >
      Project visibility should not depend on developers remembering to update tickets.
      Status is derived, not reported.
    problems_solved:
      - "Tickets marked 'in progress' for weeks"
      - "No updates until completion"
      - "Inconsistent update quality across developers"
      - "'I forgot to update the ticket'"
      - "Blocked tasks not marked"
    result: "Uniform extrapolation applied to all, regardless of diligence"
