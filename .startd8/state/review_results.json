    "status": "reviewed",
    "strengths": [
      "**Comprehensive test coverage**: The test suite covers a wide range of scenarios including YAML loading, structural validation, schema compliance, referential integrity, and security best practices.",
      "**Well-structured fixtures**: Proper use of pytest fixtures for loading config and schema files promotes code reuse and maintainability.",
      "**Good naming conventions**: Test function names clearly describe what is being tested.",
      "**Defensive validation**: Tests check for common configuration errors like undefined receivers, missing required sections, and insecure file paths.",
      "**Schema-driven validation**: Leverages JSON Schema for formal validation, which is a best practice for configuration management."
    ],
    "issues": [
      "**severity: BLOCKING** The generated code is a **test file** (`tests/test_notification_yaml.py`), but the task explicitly asks for implementation of `alertmanager/ContextCore-notification.yaml` \u2014 the actual **configuration file**, not tests. The deliverable is fundamentally incorrect for the task requirements.",
      "**severity: BLOCKING** Missing the primary artifact: The YAML configuration file `alertmanager/ContextCore-notification.yaml` is not provided. This is the core deliverable mentioned in the task title and auto-split description.",
      "**severity: MAJOR** Test assumes existence of `schema/contextcore-notification.schema.yaml` which is not provided and may not exist. This creates an external dependency that would cause test failures.",
      "**severity: MAJOR** The `test_no_unknown_top_level_keys` test has a logical error. It calls `pytest.warns()` but this doesn't actually generate warnings \u2014 it only catches them. The test will always pass without validating anything. Should use `warnings.warn()` or convert to assertion-based validation.",
      "**severity: MINOR** The constraint \"Preserve existing sections\" cannot be verified since no existing configuration file is shown or referenced. This suggests there should be a baseline configuration to preserve.",
      "**severity: MINOR** Hard-coded file paths (`CONFIG_PATH`, `SCHEMA_PATH`) reduce portability. Should use path resolution relative to test file location or accept paths as configuration.",
      "**severity: MINOR** The `test_inhibit_rules_structure` test has a confusing comment about 'equal' not being required, but the test doesn't check for 'equal' at all. This comment seems orphaned or misplaced."
