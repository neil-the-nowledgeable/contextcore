        "Well-structured Grafana dashboard JSON with proper use of `__inputs`, `__requires`, `annotations`, and `panels` sections",
        "Good observability coverage: includes capability index size, lookup latency (p50/p95/p99), query rate, error rate, and query throughput by operation",
        "Proper use of Grafana templating variables (`$datasource`, `$namespace`, `$interval`)",
        "Appropriate panel types chosen (stat for KPIs, timeseries for trends, row for organization)",
        "Sensible threshold values for color-coded alerts (e.g., error rate at 1% yellow, 5% red; latency at 0.5s yellow, 2s red)",
        "Correct use of `histogram_quantile` for latency percentiles",
        "Smart use of `clamp_min` to prevent division by zero in error rate calculation",
        "Proper use of `graphTooltip: 2` for shared crosshair tooltip mode",
        "Collapsed row sections for organized dashboard layout"

      "issues": [
        "[severity: BLOCKING] The generated code is **truncated** \u2014 the output cuts off mid-JSON at approximately 13,000 characters (visible truncation marker: `\"c` inside a threshold step, and `# ... [truncated \u2014 12981 chars omitted] ...`). This means the JSON is syntactically invalid and cannot be parsed or used as-is. The dashboard is incomplete \u2014 missing the rest of the \"Query Performance\" collapsed row panels, likely additional rows/panels, the `templating` section (where `$datasource`, `$namespace`, `$interval` variables would be defined), the `time` section, `refresh`, `schemaVersion`, `tags`, `timezone`, `title`, `uid`, and the closing braces.",
        "[severity: BLOCKING] Without the `templating` section, the dashboard variables (`$datasource`, `$namespace`, `$interval`) referenced throughout all panel queries would be undefined, making the dashboard non-functional even if the JSON were completed.",
        "[severity: MAJOR] Test results show both validators were **skipped** with reason `unknown_validator`, meaning there was effectively **no validation** performed. The \"passed\" status is misleading \u2014 it passed vacuously because no checks ran. This means we have no actual quality assurance on the output.",
        "[severity: MINOR] The file is named `ContextCore-dashboard.json` but the comment line shows `# File: ContextCore-dashboard.json` \u2014 a comment syntax that is invalid in JSON (JSON does not support comments). This would cause a parse error if included in the actual file.",
        "[severity: MINOR] Panel layout has a potential overlap: panel id=2 (latency) at x=6, w=12 spans columns 6-17, and panel id=4 (error rate) at x=18, w=6 spans columns 18-23. This works, but panel id=1 at x=0, w=6 and panel id=2 at x=6, w=12 leaves the first row using only 18 columns plus the error rate stat at x=18 \u2014 layout is functional but the latency panel could have been wider."
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Regenerate the full, complete JSON file without truncation \u2014 this is the primary fix needed",
        "Include the `templating` section with proper variable definitions for `$datasource` (type: datasource), `$namespace` (type: query), and `$interval` (type: interval)",
        "Include required top-level fields: `title`, `uid`, `schemaVersion`, `tags`, `timezone`, `time`, `refresh`, `version`, and `style`",
        "Add a `$__rate_interval` or validate that `$interval` is properly configured for rate() queries (Grafana best practice recommends `$__rate_interval`)",
        "Ensure actual validators are configured and run properly \u2014 the skipped validators provide no confidence in correctness",
        "Remove the `# File:` comment line or place it outside the JSON content",
        "Consider adding an \"Alerting\" or \"SLO\" row with panels showing SLI compliance if this is meant to be a production observability dashboard",
        "Add `\"version\": 1` and a proper `schemaVersion` (e.g., 39 for modern Grafana) to the dashboard root"
