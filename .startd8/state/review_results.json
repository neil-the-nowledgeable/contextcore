      "strengths": [
        "Well-structured, valid YAML with clear and consistent formatting",
        "Includes sensible SLO definitions (availability, latency, error rate, throughput) with reasonable targets",
        "Each SLO entry has a consistent schema: name, type, target, window, description",
        "Proper metadata fields (service, version, owner) at the top level",
        "File is self-explanatory and would be easy to consume programmatically"
      ],
      "issues": [
        "[MAJOR] The task description says \"Fallback parsed feature from plan text\" and references a \"Capability Index Structural Enhancement Plan,\" suggesting this YAML should be derived from an actual plan document. The generated content appears to be entirely fabricated/generic rather than parsed from any source plan. The SLO values (99.9% availability, 500ms p99, 0.1% error rate, 1000 RPS) look like boilerplate defaults with no evidence they reflect specific plan requirements.",
        "[MAJOR] The constraint \"Preserve existing sections\" implies there may be pre-existing content in this file that should be retained. There is no indication that any existing content was considered or preserved \u2014 the file appears to be generated from scratch. Without knowing the original file contents, we cannot verify compliance with this constraint, but the lack of any acknowledgment or handling of this is concerning.",
        "[MINOR] The test results show both validators were **skipped** due to \"unknown_validator\" \u2014 meaning no actual validation was performed. The \"passed\" status is misleading; it passed vacuously because nothing was actually checked. This should not be taken as evidence of correctness.",
        "[MINOR] The file path `ContextCore-slo.yaml` should presumably be placed under an `slo/` directory per the task description (`implement slo/ContextCore-slo.yaml only`), but the file header just shows `# File: ContextCore-slo.yaml` without the directory prefix."
      ],
      "suggestions": [
        "Clarify and obtain the actual source plan document to derive concrete, accurate SLO values rather than using generic defaults",
        "Verify whether a pre-existing `ContextCore-slo.yaml` file exists and ensure all its sections are preserved as required by the constraint",
        "Use the correct file path `slo/ContextCore-slo.yaml` to match the task specification",
        "Consider adding units explicitly to target values (e.g., `unit: ms` for latency, `unit: percent` for availability and error_rate, `unit: rps` for throughput) to avoid ambiguity",
        "Implement actual validators for YAML format validation and key preservation checking rather than relying on skipped/vacuous test results"
