        "[severity: BLOCKING] The generated code is severely incomplete \u2014 the file is truncated mid-sentence/mid-code-block. The markdown code fence for verifying the Python version is opened but never closed, and the document ends abruptly after \"Verify your Python version:\". A runbook should contain operational sections like setup, running, troubleshooting, monitoring, incident response, etc.",
        "[severity: BLOCKING] The task title references \"Capability Index Structural Enhancement Plan\" but the generated runbook content makes no mention of capability indices, structural enhancements, or any domain-specific ContextCore concepts. The content is entirely generic boilerplate that could apply to any Python project.",
        "[severity: MAJOR] There is no meaningful operational guidance \u2014 no instructions for running the application, no configuration details, no troubleshooting steps, no monitoring or alerting guidance, no escalation procedures. These are fundamental components of any runbook.",
        "[severity: MAJOR] The task description mentions this was \"auto-split from PI-001: implement `runbooks/ContextCore-runbook.md` only\" suggesting a specific implementation plan existed, but the output shows no evidence of following any design document or plan."

      "suggestions": [

        "Include ContextCore-specific operational details rather than generic Python project boilerplate",
        "Ensure all markdown code fences are properly opened and closed"
