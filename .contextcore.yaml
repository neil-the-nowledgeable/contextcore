  description: |
    Project management observability framework modeling tasks as OpenTelemetry spans.
    Dual-telemetry architecture: spans to Tempo (hierarchy, timing, TraceQL) and
    structured logs to Loki (events, status changes, metrics derivation via recording rules).

# Current implementation status
status:
  phase: "Phase 4 - OTel GenAI Alignment"
  recentChanges:
    - "OTel GenAI semantic convention alignment (dual-emit agent.* + gen_ai.*)"
    - "HistoricalTaskTracker now emits both spans AND logs for demo data"
    - "Exporter supports pushing logs to Loki via push API"
    - "Portfolio dashboard updated with 6 dashboards provisioned"
    - "Dashboard $project variables fixed to default to 'contextcore'"
    - "Identified task tracking vs deliverable validation gap"
  nextSteps:
    - "Verify demo data appears in both Tempo and Loki"
    - "Create agent insights dashboard for gen_ai.* attributes"
    - "Implement Loki recording rules for task_percent_complete metrics"
    - "Add deliverable validation to task completion criteria"

      priority: P3
      mitigation: "Add retry logic and user-visible error notifications"

      scope:
        - "docs/semantic-conventions.md"
        - "loki/rules/"

    - risk: "Task 'done' status tracks execution, not deliverable completion"
      priority: P2
      mitigation: |
        Task tracking captures workflow execution status (ran successfully) but not
        whether expected deliverables were produced. Add deliverable validation:
        1. Post-completion hooks that verify expected outputs exist
        2. Span events with deliverable checksums or existence checks
        3. Dashboard panels showing tasks vs verified deliverables

        - "docs/semantic-conventions.md"
      lesson: |
        Discovered via phase tasks that marked 11 tasks as 'done' in Tempo but
        expected document sections were not created. Execution ≠ completion.

designDecisions:
  - decision: "Model tasks as OpenTelemetry spans for unified observability"
    confidence: 0.95
    rationale: "Spans have same structure as tasks (start, end, status, hierarchy)"

  - decision: "Export via OTLP for vendor independence"
    confidence: 0.92
    rationale: "Avoid lock-in, works with any OTLP-compatible backend"

  - decision: "Use Pydantic v2 for CRD schema validation"
    confidence: 0.88
    rationale: "Strict validation, good error messages, Python-native"

  - decision: "Store agent insights as spans in Tempo"
    confidence: 0.85
    rationale: "Reuse existing infrastructure, enables time-range queries"

  - decision: "Dual-emit spans (Tempo) AND logs (Loki) for complete observability"
    confidence: 0.90
    rationale: |
      Portfolio dashboard requires both: Tempo for task hierarchy/timing queries,
      Loki for event streams and metrics derivation via recording rules.
      Mimir metrics are derived from Loki logs, not directly emitted.

  - decision: "Align with OTel GenAI semantic conventions via dual-emit"
    confidence: 0.88
    rationale: |
      Emit both agent.* (legacy) and gen_ai.* (OTel standard) attributes during
      migration period. Controlled by CONTEXTCORE_OTEL_MODE env var.
      See docs/OTEL_GENAI_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for migration path.

  - decision: "Demo generator emits both spans and logs"
    confidence: 0.92
    rationale: |
      HistoricalTaskTracker now uses HistoricalTaskLogger to emit logs with
      historical timestamps alongside spans. Enables full dashboard testing.
